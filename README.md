# NeurOwn Website

This is the repository for the NeurOwn startup website, built using React and Vite. We deploy
this as a static site after transpiling.

The project is currently WIP and under active development.

## Getting Started

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your machine. Try to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and install 22.x or higher.

Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NeurOwnLLM/website.git neurown_website
cd neurown_website
pnpm install
```
To start the development server, run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the website in your default browser. The server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

## TODO:
