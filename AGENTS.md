## ⚡ AI Agent Coding Principles

* ✅ **Autonomy with communication:** Try to implement independently; ask the human developer when blocked.
* ✅ **Code readability:** Favor clarity over cleverness — self-documenting code is preferred.
* ✅ **Consistency:** Match existing file structure, naming, and style conventions.
* ✅ **Testing:** Ensure linting passes and builds succeed.
* ✅ **Documentation:** Add inline comments for non-obvious logic; update component-level docs as needed.
* ⚠️ **Do not** alter configuration files (Vite, tsconfig, etc.) unless necessary and explained.
* ⚠️ **Do not** add dependencies without clear justification.

## Collaboration Notes

* The **human developer (user)** is an experienced engineer — ask concise, technical questions if something is unclear.
* When making decisions, explain your reasoning briefly and clearly.
